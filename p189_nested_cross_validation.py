''' nested_cross_validation.py
Nested Cross Validation is a method for tuning model parameters minimizing bias.

There is an outer k-fold cross validation loop and an inner k-fold cross 
validation loop.

The outer fold selects a number, such as 10 different training and
test sets without replacement so each sample ends up being used as a
test sample exactly once.

The inner fold uses the training portion of the outer fold, and does a 
Grid Search to select a classification model, such as 'linear' SVM version 'rbf'
or Decision Tree versus SVM.

If the model is stable, then the inner loops should all chose the same 
classifier type.

After selecting the classifier then the outer folds are used for tuning, via
k-fold classification.

This program uses the sklearn GridSearch Cross Validation that internally uses
a 5 outer fold, 2 inner folder algorithm to tune parameters.
