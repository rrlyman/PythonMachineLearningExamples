'''standard_scalar illustrates the use of the scaling from
    the sklearn tools.
    1) column sums from the E13B dataset are read in as features.
    2) Features are scaled with the sklearn StandardScaler
    3) The features are then fitted to a Perceptron and the decision regions
        are plotted.
