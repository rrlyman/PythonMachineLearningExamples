'''mode_precision_recall.py

    Precision and recall are measures of true positives. 
    Precision is also called positive predictive value. 
    Precision is "how useful the search results are".
    
    Recall is also called sensitivity
    Recall is  "how complete the results are".
    
    Combining them is the F1 score
    It is the harmonic meanof Precision and Recall
    
    Given a couple of E13B, compute the precision and recall values.
    Make a scorer using the F1 measure as the score and use
    grid search to find the parameters that give the highest F1 measure
