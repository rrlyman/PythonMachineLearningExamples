learning_curves.py

The learning curve shows the training and test accuracies versus the number
of training samples.  This can be used to determine if there are enough
training samples to sufficiently fit the training data.  If the curves
flatten out then there are enough samples.  If there is a big difference 
between the training and test accuracies then under and over fitting
can be determined.

The validation curve can be used to test a range of an estimation 
parameter such as the inverse regularization parameter, C, to see how the
test and accuracy varies.  This can be used to pick a value of C to reduce
over fitting and under fitting.
